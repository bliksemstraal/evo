## Status & Contributing

Evo is a general framework for developing genetic algorithms and more. It began life in fall 2015 as I studied evolutionary algorithms as an undergrad. The most recent release is [v0.2.0].

Contributions are welcome! I am currently a student and inexperienced maintainer, so please bear with me as I learn. The focus of the project thus far has been on the API design and less on performance. I am particularly interested in hearing about use-cases that are not well covered and success stories of where Evo excels. Testing, code reviews, and performance audits are always welcome and needed.

## Examples

You can browse example problems in the [example subpackage]. The examples are maintained as a development tool rather than to provide optimal solutions to the problems they tackle. Reading the examples should give you a good idea of how easy it is to write code with Evo.
